# My personal webapp!
Welcome to the codebase for my website! This is a webapp designed with React, Redux and Django!

## My Skillset
I have designed my site to showcase everything that I am capable of doing for you!
It also has a dual purpose:
  1. To show career employers my areas of expertise.
  2. To show contractors the type of webapps/full apps I am capable of providing.


## "Show me, don't tell me."
I have created a whole webapp for you to play around in, so you can see the full range of my skillset as a programmer.
This site has been designed to give you a front row seat into the way that I think, learn and code.
